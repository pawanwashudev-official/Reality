## 🌟 Why Reality?

Most productivity apps are dumb. They set a timer, block an app, and hope for the best.

**Reality is different.** It is a **fully intelligent ecosystem** that integrates deeply with your Google Workspace to organize your life, coaching you to success while strictly protecting your focus with military-grade precision.

It doesn't just block distractions; it **understands your goals**.
