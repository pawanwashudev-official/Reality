## 🤔 Why Does Reality Exist?

We searched for the **perfect productivity app**. We found:
- ❌ **Paid Apps**: Want $50/year just to block Instagram? No thanks.
- ❌ **"Free" Apps**: Selling your data to advertisers. You're the product.
- ❌ **One-Trick Apps**: A timer here. A to-do list there. No integration.
- ❌ **Closed Ecosystems**: Your data locked in proprietary servers.

**Reality was born from frustration.** Built by two friends who lost control of their own fingers. Designed for students and working professionals who want to use their phone **for getting things done**, not doom-scrolling.

## 💡 The Google Ecosystem Advantage

Reality doesn't reinvent the wheel. It **weaponizes Google's own tools** for your productivity.

### 📄 Google Docs Integration
- **AI Diary & Reflection**: Your daily journal is written directly to **Google Docs**.
- **AI Plans**: Tomorrow's plan is a structured document in your Drive.
- **Gemini Ready**: Because your data is in Docs, Google's Gemini can analyze and assist with it natively!

### ✅ Google Tasks & Calendar
- **Native Sync**: Add a task in Reality → it appears in Google Tasks instantly.
- **Schedule Adherence XP**: Earn XP for attending your planned calendar blocks.
- **Gemini Control**: Google's Gemini app can see and manage your tasks/events seamlessly.

### ☁️ Google Drive Backup
- **Automatic Reports**: Your daily PDF reports are uploaded to **YOUR** Drive folder.
- **Full Control**: Access, share, or delete them anytime. It's your data.
- **No Our Servers**: We have **literally zero servers**. Your data never touches us.

> **The result?** Reality becomes a power-user extension of the **Gemini-powered Google Workspace**. Not a separate silo.

## ⚔️ Military-Grade App Blocking: The "Armored Strict Mode"

Standard blockers are weak. A 5-year-old can bypass them. Reality creates an **impenetrable fortress** around your focus.

### 🔒 Armored Strict Mode
- **Device Admin Protection**: Blocks uninstall attempts during active focus.
- **Time Tampering Detection**: Changing system time to bypass? **Detected immediately.**
- **Accessibility Guard**: Catches sneaky app launches via overlays and intent hijacks.
- **Loop Hole Closers**: We didn't just build a blocker. We analyzed every single bypass on the internet and **closed them all**.

### 🔥 Tapasya Mode
A focus mode so intense, it's named after the Sanskrit word for "deep, burning discipline".
- Starts Focus Mode automatically.
- Saves state even if your phone reboots.
- Plays warning sounds when your break is about to end.

| **Transient Storage** | Detailed analytics live locally for 3 days, then are wiped or synced to your Drive. |
| **Open Source Audit** | Every line of code is public. Build the APK yourself if you don't trust us. |
