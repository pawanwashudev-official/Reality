# 🎉 Reality v1.0.3 - Stability Update

**Release Date:** 2026-02-01
**Build:** 23

### ⚠️ Critical Fixes
- **Screen Time Crash Fixed**: Resolved a "Null Object" crash in the Nightly Process caused by R8 minification stripping data models. Protected `FocusModeData` and added robust null-safety checks.
- **UI Insets Glitch Fixed**: Fixed an issue where the status bar and navigation bar spacing would break after navigating between pages. Now enforces pixel-perfect Edge-to-Edge layout on every resume.

### 🛡️ Optimizations
- **R8 Enabled**: Full code shrinking and obfuscation enabled for a smaller, faster, and more secure app.
- **Code Hardening**: Extensive ProGuard rules added to protect critical components (Nightly Process, Google APIs, Health Connect, Rooms).
- **API Cleanliness**: Resolved all deprecated API warnings for Android 11+ (API 30+).
