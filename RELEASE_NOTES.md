## 🔥 Why Reality is the #1 Choice

> **Reality isn't just an app. It's a movement.**
>
> While other screen-time apps slap a timer on your phone and call it a day, Reality rewires your entire relationship with technology. It blocks, protects, reflects, reports, and evolves — all powered by AI, all running on YOUR data, stored in YOUR Google Drive. No servers. No tracking. No compromise.

## ⚡ Complete Feature Arsenal

### 🛡️ Military-Grade App Blocking
The most **unbreakable** blocking system ever built for Android.

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Armored Strict Mode** | Locks your phone for up to **20 days**. No escape button. No uninstall. No settings access. |
| **Focus Mode** | Block distracting apps with a single tap. Choose your apps, set your duration. |
| **Schedule Blocking** | Set automatic daily blocking windows (e.g., 10 PM – 6 AM). |
| **Calendar Sync** | Auto-block during your Google Calendar events. Meeting starts? Distractions die. |
| **Anti-Cheat Engine** | Detects time manipulation, prevents uninstall attempts, guards accessibility service. |
| **Learning Mode** | Shows a gentle reminder overlay instead of a hard block — perfect for building habits. |

### 🧠 AI-Powered Nightly Protocol
Every night, Reality conducts an **intelligent AI interview** about your day.
